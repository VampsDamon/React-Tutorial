Chapter 02 - Assignment - Igniting our App
Please Note: Write the answers and code on your own while finishing your assignments. Try to
put down your thoughts into words by yourself in your own words. (This will help you develop
muscle memory and you will remember all the concepts properly) ✌
# Theory Assignment:
● - What is `NPM`?
<p>
It work as a node package manager , which manges all the files ,modules .
</p>
● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
<p>
Parcel and webPack are Bundelers ,we use these bundelsers cause it's minify our codes ,cleans our code and also Optimize our code.
</p>
● - What is `.parcel-cache`
<p>
.parcel-cache is a cache file which save all the information of parcel file when we use same command again and again then it's reduce the execution time due to parcel cache file 
</p>
● - What is `npx` ?
<p>
npx is ued to run any file in parcel to run file we use command like 'npx parcel filename' 
</p>
● - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`
<p>
The main differnece b/w dependencies and the devDependencies is ,devD is used during developemnt and it's include those file only which is used in development point of view whereas D is includes all those files which is used for  productuon .
  By separating devDependencies from dependencies, you can keep your production environment clean and lightweight by avoiding the installation of unnecessary development tools.
</p>
● - What is Tree Shaking?
<p>

Tree shaking is a technique used in modern JavaScript build processes to eliminate unused or dead code from your application, resulting in smaller bundle sizes and improved performance. It's particularly relevant in the context of module systems like ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and tools like webpack.

The term "tree shaking" comes from the idea of shaking a tree to make dead leaves fall off, leaving only the healthy ones. Similarly, tree shaking analyzes your codebase and "shakes off" any parts of the code that are not actually being used, thus reducing the final size of the output bundle that gets delivered to the browser.
</p>
● - What is Hot Module Replacement?
<p>
HMR is development feature used to load save changes in the page without refreshing it .

Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a development feature that lets you see code changes in the browser without refreshing the page. It maintains the app's state and speeds up development. Not for production use.

</p>
● - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words.
<ul>
<li>HMR</li>
<li>Image optimization
  <p>It's otimized the image size also</p>
</li>
<li>Minifying
<p>It's minify the code which makes easy to load during the Production</p>
</li>
<li>Caching while Developmant</li>
<li>Remove console logs</li>
</ul>

● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
`.gitignore` is a special file in a Git repository that tells Git which files and folders to ignore and not include in version control. This helps keep your repository clean and avoids adding unnecessary or sensitive files.

**Add to `.gitignore`:**
- **Build Artifacts:** Files or folders generated during development or compilation, like compiled code, executables, and temporary files.
- **Dependencies:** Libraries and packages installed via package managers like npm, as these can be easily reinstalled.
- **User-Specific Files:** Configurations or files that differ between users, like editor settings or local environment files.
- **Sensitive Information:** Files containing passwords, API keys, and other confidential data.

**Do Not Add to `.gitignore`:**
- **Source Code:** Your actual source code files that you want to track and share.
- **Documentation:** Important documentation files that help others understand your project.
- **Configuration Templates:** Keep generic configuration templates in version control, but not specific configurations with sensitive data.

Remember, the goal of `.gitignore` is to keep your repository focused on code and shared resources, while excluding temporary, user-specific, or sensitive files.


● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

package.json is a manually maintained metadata file for your project and its dependencies, while package-lock.json is an automatically generated file that keeps track of exact dependency versions and their tree structure for consistency and reproducibility across different environments.

● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
<p>
We should not modify cause it's auto generated file which is generated by npm if we modify then it's leads to compatiblity issues ,dependency conflicts
</p>
● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
<p>
We can say node module as directory of npm where all the files are stored which is install or import through npm ,

We does not push node module file on git hub cause it's auto generated and it's easy to acces during production ,when we push on these files on github then it's take too many sapace on gitHub 
</p>
● - What is the `dist` folder?
<p>
It is that folder which consists optimized .html,.css and .js file which is ready to push on production server 
These files are created during the building of the project either for development site or a Production site.
</p>
● - What is `browserlists`
<p>
It is used to listing of the browser where our webApp is supported

Bundlers: Vite, Webpack, Parcel:

Vite:

Vite is a build tool and development server that focuses on fast development and performance.
It leverages native ES modules for faster loading during development.
Vite supports various frontend frameworks like Vue.js and React.
It provides near-instantaneous hot module replacement (HMR) for a smoother development experience.
Webpack:

Webpack is a highly flexible and powerful bundler commonly used in complex projects.
It can handle various types of assets (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and dependencies.
Webpack offers extensive configuration options and supports code splitting for optimized loading.
It's popular for its ability to transform and bundle assets, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
Parcel:

Parcel is an easy-to-use zero-config bundler that aims to simplify the development process.
It automatically handles most common configurations without the need for explicit setup.
Parcel supports multiple types of assets and provides out-of-the-box support for various frontend technologies.
It's a great choice for small to medium-sized projects where simplicity is a priority.
Caret (^) and Tilde (~):

Caret (^):

In a version specification like "^1.2.3", the caret allows for updates within the same major version. For example, it would allow updating from 1.2.3 to 1.5.0 but not to 2.0.0.
It's suitable when you want to receive new features and bug fixes but want to avoid breaking changes.
Tilde (~):

In a version specification like "~1.2.3", the tilde allows for updates up to the next compatible minor version. For example, it would allow updating from 1.2.3 to 1.2.9 but not to 1.3.0.
It's useful when you only want to receive bug fixes and patches but avoid new features.
Script Types in HTML (MDN Docs):

In HTML, the script element is used to include and execute JavaScript code on a web page. The type attribute specifies the scripting language being used. Common type values include:

"text/javascript": This was the original and default value for JavaScript code.
"module": Indicates that the script should be treated as an ES module, enabling modern module features.
"text/ecmascript": Used to specify ECMAScript, the standardized scripting language that JavaScript is based on.
"application/javascript": Similar to "text/javascript," but with a more specific MIME type.
"application/x-javascript": Another way to specify JavaScript code.
The recommended practice is to use "module" for modern JavaScript modules and "text/javascript" for traditional scripts. Browsers will default to treating unrecognized type values as JavaScript.
